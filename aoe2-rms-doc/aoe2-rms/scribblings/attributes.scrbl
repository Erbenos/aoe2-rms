@defproc[(random-placement)
         void?]{
 Sections: @racket[<PLAYER-SETUP>].

 Mutually exclusive with: @racket[grouped-by-team]

 Game versions: All

 Players are positioned in a circle with some variation. This is the default, and will apply even if
 you do not type it.

 Example:
 @racketmod[
 aoe2-rms

 <PLAYER-SETUP>
 (random-placement)
 ]

 Sections: @racket[<PLAYER-SETUP>].

 Mutually exclusive with: @racket[random-placement]

 Game versions: UP/HD/DE

 Requires: Team Together box ticked in the lobby (on by default)

 Players of the same team are positioned in close proximity to each other. Distance between
 team members is double the @racket[base-size] used in @racket[create-player-lands].

 Example:
 @racketmod[
 aoe2-rms

 <PLAYER-SETUP>
 (grouped-by-team)
 ]
}

@defproc[(direct-placement) void?]{
 Sections: @racket[<PLAYER-SETUP>].

 Game versions: UP/DE

 Allows the @racket[land-position] attribute in @racket[create-land] to be used in combination with the
 @racket[assign-to-player] or @racket[assign-to] attributes to individually position players at exact positions on the
 map.

 @itemlist[
 @item{On UP, !P will be appended to the map name in the objectives window.}
 @item{On UP, it can be used in combination with @racket[random-placement] / @racket[grouped-by-team] but it
   only works when using @racket[land-position]}
 @item{
   On DE, it disables @racket[random-placement] and @racket[grouped-by-team], but doesn't necessarily
   require @racket[land-position] - it is possible to just specify borders instead. If used with
   @racket[create-player-lands], these lands will be positioned entirely at random (ignoring the
   normal circular positioning), so this is usually not desirable.}

 Game versions: UP/HD/DE

 Adds the cost of a town center (275 Wood, 100 Stone) to every player's starting resources. Use
 this in your custom nomad map if you want players to be able to build a town center without first
 gathering wood.
 @itemlist[
 @item{In DE, this adds the actual cost of a town center for the player's civilization. ie. Incas

@defproc[(force-nomad-treaty) void?]{
 Sections: @racket[<PLAYER-SETUP>].

 Game versions: DE only

 Activates a treaty period on nomad maps which lasts until every player has completed a town
 center or until 5 min have elapsed, whichever occurs first. Nomad treaty prevents combat and
 prevents construction within 10 tiles of another player's town center (foundation).

 @itemlist[
 @item{
   The border of the 10 tile radius is visible in explored tiles, which makes finding enemy
   town centers much easier. For this reason, nomad maps for tournament games often
   intentionally choose not to have a nomad treaty, while instead having rules against early
   villager fighting.

 Used for versioning changes that might affect how existing maps generate. Changes land
 generation such that when specifying @racket[number-of-tiles] or @racket[land-percent], the square amount
 covered by the @racket[base-size] is included in the total, rather than being additive. Also fixes a bug
 where land order would influence the generation.

   appropriate place to put it, so it is listed here.}
 @item{May be used in the future to gate off more fixes and changes that might break

 BUG (DE): Does not default to GRASS, so make sure to specify the base terrain.

 In @racket[<LAND-GENERATION>], specifies a terrain to initially fill the map. Maps with rivers going through them or oceans on the outside usually use water. Maps with forest on the outside usually use forest terrain.

 In @racket[<ELEVATION-GENERATION>], terrains on which the hill(s) should generate.  If you have multiple terrains you want hills on, then you need multiple @racket[create-elevation] blocks.

 Note that you only need to consider terrains from @racket[<LAND-GENERATION>], as @racket[<TERRAIN-GENERATION>] occurs after elevation has already been placed.

 Blocks: @racket[create-player-lands], @racket[create-land].

 Game versions: All

 Arguments:
 @itemlist[
 @item{radius - number (default: 3)}
 ]

 Square radius of the initially placed land origin, before any growth.

 The default of 3 results in a 7x7 land origin (49 tiles total).

 @racket[base-size] will produce a perfect square if used with @racket[land-percent] 0 or @racket[number-of-tiles] 0.

 @racket[base-size] is the minimum distance that a land will be placed from the edge of the map.

 Land bases are placed sequentially, so if they are large and overlap, the land placed last will be the one visible in the overlapping region.

 Non-player land bases will not overlap with each other, unless...

 If @racket[base-size] for non-player lands is too large, the land will fail to find a valid position and will be placed at the center of the map, overlapping any other lands at the center.

 Example: Create a 13x13 square of ice

 The square land origin becomes a circle of the size that would be exactly inscribed by the square.

 Land origins with a @racket[base-size] of 3 or smaller will still be a perfect square, while larger bases will be more obviously circular.
 Can be used to produce a perfect circle if combined with @racket[land-percent] 0 or @racket[number-of-tiles] 0.

 Disabled when using @racket[assign-to-player] or @racket[assign-to] for @racket[create-land], unless @racket[direct-placement] is specified in @racket[<PLAYER-SETUP>].

 Positions outside of the map can theoretically be used if the crash conditions are avoid?ed.

 Note: 100 for the Y coordinate (or anything outside the map) will crash the game if your map uses @racket[<CONNECTION-GENERATION>] and has a connection that needs to reach this land specifically, or if the land uses @racket[assign-to-player].

 ]

 Used in @racket[create-player-lands] to position the player lands in a circle with equal distance to the center, with specified variance.

 @racket[circle-radius] ignores any specified borders when placing the land origins, but land growth will still be constrained by borders.

 There is also a command called @racket[circle-placement] which is used in the standard maps and listed in the official documentation. That command is non-functional.

 If used for multiple unique @racket[create-player-lands] commands, only the final radius will apply.

 BUG: if used for multiple player lands while also using @racket[grouped-by-team], the additional land positions will not generate properly.

 If used for @racket[create-land], it will still apply to player lands normally.

 See Circle Radius Comparison in the appendix for a comparison of not using @racket[circle-radius] to a radius with no variance.

 Game versions: All

 Arguments:
 @itemlist[
 @item{percentage - number (0-99) (default: 0)}
 ]

 Specify a percentage of map width for land placement and growth to stay away from the given border.

 Left is southwest; right is northeast, top is northwest; bottom is southeast.

 There is a hard-coded feature that makes lands look like octagons instead of squares when constrained by borders.

 Borders shift the entire circle of all the player lands.

 You cannot have multiple rings of player lands with different borders; they will all be in the same circle.

 Due to rounding, the exact number of tiles that a given percentage value corresponds to may not be the same for each side.
 For example, to stop 2 tiles from the edge on a tiny (120x120) map, a value of 2 must be used for the top and left borders, but a value of 3 is needed for the bottom and right borders.

 Negative values can be used, as long as the land origin stays inside the map. To ensure this, do one of the following:
 @itemlist[
 @item{Specify a @racket[land-position] within the map}
 @item{Specify a sufficiently large @racket[base-size] (this may require manually scaling of @racket[base-size] with map size)}
 ]

 BUG: asymmetric borders for player lands can cause issues when the @racket[top-border] is larger than other borders (External reference: @hyperlink["http://aok.heavengames.com/cgi-bin/forums/display.cgi?action=ct&f=28,42496,0,365"]{RMS Border Bugs Exposed}). Avoid? this by always using another border along with @racket[top-border] when creating player lands.

 Specifies the extent to which land growth respects borders and actually stops at a border.

 Low values allow lands to exceed specified borders, giving ragged looking edges when land is constrained by borders.

 0 causes land growth to ignore borders entirely.

 100 (or any negative value) means that borders are fully respected, resulting in perfectly straight lands along borders.

 In @racket[<LAND-GENERATION>], defaults to 8, useful range being about 0-40. The extent to which land growth prefers to clump together near existing tiles. Moderate values (11-40) create rounder lands, while low values (0-10) create more irregular lands, and high values (40+) create lands that extend in one direction away from the origin. Negative values create extremely snakey lands, and are generally not recommended.

 In @racket[<TERRAIN-GENERATION>], defaults to 20, useful range being about 0-25. The extent to which terrain tiles prefer to be together next to other tiles of the same clump.  Moderate values (5-25) create rounder terrain patches, while low values (0-5) create more irregular terrain patches.  Negative values create extremely snakey terrains.

 Assign a numeric label to a land, which can later be used to place objects specifically on that land with @racket{place-on-specific-land-id}.
 This is unrelated to any zone numbers.

 Multiple lands can have the same ID. In this case, objects will be placed on all of them.

 This is sometimes useful for creating "fake" player lands to generate forests or ponds between players.

 Note that objects may be placed on surrounding terrain rather than the land itself, if the surrounding terrain supports the object placement.

 Given that a Ludicrously-sized map is 480 tiles wide, 961 would be enough to cover the entire map in all situations.

 When a connection passes through a tile of the specified terrain, the area within radius +/- variance will be subject to @racket[replace-terrain] / @racket[default-terrain-replacement] and terrains will be replaced accordingly.

 This attribute can be used multiple times for different terrains.

 A radius of 0 will still replace a single-tile width path.

 Variance is randomly selected for each tile crossed.

 If variance is larger than radius, it can reduce the radius to a negative value, in which case no terrain will be replaced around these specific locations.

 Example: Connect players with a variable ragged-looking road, and with shallows that are slightly wider.

@defproc[(find-closest) void?]{
 Blocks: @racket[create-object].

 Game versions: DE only

 Requires: @racket[set-place-for-every-player] or @racket[place-on-specific-land-id]

 Place the object on the closest free tile to the center of the land, considering all other constraints.

 @bold{Important:}

 @racket[find-closest] uses circular (Euclidean) distance, whereas other distance constraints (e.g., @racket[min-distance-to-players]) use square distance by default.

 Because of this, using both @racket[find-closest] and @racket[min-distance-to-players] (without additional constraints) may cause objects to be placed at right angles to each other, as the square's corners are farther from the center than its edges. Use @racket[set-circular-placement] combined with @racket[enable-tile-shuffling] to resolve this issue.

 @itemlist[
 @item{Previously, using @racket[find-closest] with reference to a land origin would place the object directly on the origin (if no other restrictions applied). But now, it places the object one tile away.}
 @item{Use @racket[max-distance-to-players 0] if you need the object placed exactly on the origin.}

 Place the object only within the radius of the specified @racket[actor-area] or @racket[create-actor-area].

 The same object can only have one @racket[actor-area-to-place-in].

 Actor areas have some intricacies that can affect placement. If you are having issues, follow these guidelines:

 @itemlist[
 @item{Different objects can be assigned to the same actor area.}
 @item{Do not place origin-referenced (either player or land id) objects in generic actor areas.}
 @item{Placing generic objects into land id-referenced actor areas always works.}
 @item{Placing generic objects into land id-referenced actor areas always works.}
 @item{Placing player objects into land id-referenced actor areas always works.}
 @item{Only player objects should be placed into player-referenced actor areas.}
 @item{When placing generic objects in generic actor areas, try to have the fewest @racket[create-object] commands possible between the actor area creation and the object to be placed in it.}
 @item{When none of the rules can be satisfied, inverse actor areas can be used as a failsafe.}
